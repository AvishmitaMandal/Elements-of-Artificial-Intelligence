# 2.1. Fairies Arrangement - A* Algorithm and Heuristics

Data Structure:
- State: The state represents the current state of fairies in a row.
- Goal State: The goal state is when the fairies are arranged in ascending order from 1 to N.
- Successor Function: It returns a list of possible successor states generated by swapping adjacent fairies.
- Evaluation Function: The evaluation function, `f(s)` is defined as `f(s) = g(s) + h(s)`, where `g(s)` is the cost from the initial state to state `s`, and `h(s)` is the heuristic function.

Formulation of the Search Problem:

1. State Space:
   - The state space consists of all possible states of fairies in a row, where each fairy has a magical symbol from 1 to N.
   - For N fairies, the total number of possible states is N!.

2. Successor Function:
   - The successor function generates possible next states by swapping two adjacent fairies in the current state.
   - For a state with N fairies, there are (N-1) possible successors.

4. Goal State:
   - The goal state is achieved when the fairies are arranged in ascending order from 1 to N.

5. Heuristic Function:
   - The heuristic function `h(s)` is designed to estimate the number of steps required to reach the goal state from the current state.
   - Our chosen heuristic counts the number of inversions in the state, here an inversion is a pair of fairies that are out of order as compared of goal      state.

How the Program Works:
- The program uses the A* algorithm with a priority queue to efficiently search through the state space.
- It starts with the initial state and explores successors based on their estimated cost using the evaluation logic.
- The goal state is reached when the fairies are arranged in ascending order.
- The program returns the path from the initial state to the goal state, indicating the sequence of fairy swaps to achieve the goal.

Problems Faced and Design Decisions:
Attempt 1:
Initial implementation with a heuristic function based on Manhattan distance.
  
Attempt 2:
Modified the heuristic function to count the number of inversions, which provides a more effective estimate.

Conclusion:
- The A* algorithm with the selected heuristic function correclty solves the problem by searching towards the goal state while minimizing the number of steps required to rearrange the fairies in ascending order.
- The use of a priority queue ensures efficient exploration of the state space, making the program suitable for solving the puzzle for various states.
